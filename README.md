# Milestone Project 1

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to showcase everything I have learned within the HTML, CSS and User Centric modules of the Code Institute Full Stack Development course. A full list of technologies used can be found in the technologies section of this document.

The purpose of the website for Empire Drives is to promote their business and showcase the services that they offer. The client wants the website to attract more customers and get them to take the first step by requesting a quotation. Please see below for the link to the website.

There will also be a submit button, but this can't be used unless all fields are filled out correctly. If the fields aren't filled out correctly a error message will display when clicking submit. 
<br>
<br>

### Features Left to Implement

**Review Page**
<br>
The customer would like a page for customer reviews. It will need a review form that the customer will need to fill out to submit their review. This will then need to be checked by the customer before it goes onto the page to prevent any spam. This was not apart of the original plan and will be implemented in the future.

## Issues

**Footer would not stay at the bottom**
<br>
To resolve this I made the footer sticky by using code from the following website.
<br>
https://css-tricks.com/couple-takes-sticky-footer/
<br>
<br>
<br>
**Collapsible nav bar links took up too much space on small devices**
<br>
To resolve this I made the nav bar links appear vertical rather than horizontal. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
**There was alot of space between the section and footer on larger devices**
<br>
To resolve this I added more text content to the Home, Tarmac and Paving pages.
<br>
<br>
